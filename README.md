  * Remarks: 
    * To be fair for all lab sections, there will be only one lab (2h) during week 39 (National Day for Truth and Reconciliation) and week 49 (the term ends on a Thursday :shrug:)
    

### Guest lecturers

* Dr. [Charlotte Truchet](https://www.normalesup.org/~truchet/) (University of Nantes)
  * Topic: Switching Paradigm (_to be refined_) 
* Dr. [Serge Guelton](https://developers.redhat.com/author/serge-guelton) (RedHat)
  * Topic: Assembly programming (_to be refined_) 

### Evaluations

In this course, 50% of the final grade is composed of individual work (two coding competitions and one exam), and 50% is composed of team projects (three 3-weeks labs, by pair of two students).

| Name | Kind | Weight | Due date |
| :--- | :--: | :----: | :------: |
| London subway | team | 20% |
| _Code Competition_ #1 (CC1) | individual | 15% |
| Bin Packing | team | 20% |
| _Code Competition_ #2 (CC2) | individual | 15% |
| RedBellySnake | team | 10% |
| Final exam | individual | 20% |

Deliveries are due at 23:59:59 (Toronto time). Late deliveries will not be considered (as in **will not be graded**).
